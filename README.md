# Multitask-Bayesian-SVM

Project on Multitask Bayesian SVMs that utilised the probabilistic mdeling of SVMs and EM alogrithms.
The multiple (T) related tasks are modeled through a generative model in which the weights of different SVMs
are drawn from K clusters of weights, with each cluster modeled by a Gaussian Distribution.
